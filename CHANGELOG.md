# Changelog

## Version 1.0.0

- The plugin currently supports three workflows: Import of persons via login/external account, import of persons via matriculation numbers, enrollment of persons based on role affiliation.
- Logins and matriculation numbers can be imported as text lists or files (TXT, CSV, Excel).
- Three processing methods are available: Enroll persons of the list, match list of persons (enroll missing memberships, remove unnecessary memberships) or remove list of persons.
  The actions can be executed ad-hoc when saving or, if desired, also regularly as a cronjob.
- The workflows are currently available in courses and groups (configurable per workflow).
- Workflows can be made available to persons who can manage members in the respective object or be granted to a set of local and global roles.
- More workflows will be added in future versions of the plugin, contact support@sr.solutions if you are interested in another workflow.
